#### List of OS/distros I've used or got fimiliar with
 - **Android** 4, 6, 9, 10
 - **Windows** 7, 10
   - Currently spent the most time in PowerShell ISE & FL Studio 12
   - Currently Windows is still the only OS that I have made profit with, thanks to CMD & PowerShell
 - **Cisco IOS**
   - Enterprise networking, I've spent more time using it than all non-Android Linux distros combined
 - **Ubuntu** LTS 18.04, 20.04
    - Usable
    - Tried out Docker, the docker account registration was a tune down
    - Deployed a high availably website stack for school project, with OpenWRT with true DMZ
    - Libre Office impressivly opened my x264 tutorials correctly, given the complexity and advanced formattings were used inside
 - **Red Hat / RHEL** 7, 8
    - Kickstart (with enough configurations you may actually clone your RHEL OS with it)
      - The idea that you could configure things without needing a restart like:
      - "echo 10.0.1.100 thatmachine>>/etc/hosts", "echo PREFIX=24>>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s3" (network setting)
      - is kind of mindblowing, whereas Windows Deployment Server is Windows-Server exclusive and clunky for home users
    - nftable
      - Unintuitive, easy to make configuration mistakess
      - Configuration file will become unreadable after a year of not looking after it
    - nmap & nessus scanners
    - Git server
    - Ansible & its playbook
    - GPG encryption & decryption
    - Bash scripts
      - Created some cool shells

#### Enterprise networking joke 1, should be decent:
 1. Separate LANs with VLAN
 2. Implement inter-VLAN routing which puts them back together
 3. Congratulations, you've achieved NOTHING!!

#### Enterprise networking joke 2, should be more than decent:
 - The term "high-availability" is basically:
   1. another one (DRBD)
   2. another one (heartbeat)
   3. another one (HSRP)
   4. annnnd another one (IPMI)  ——DJ Khaled (meme)
 - Using the original meme video is likely to double the fun

#### AAA stands for Authenticaion, Authorization, Accounting... MUST REMEMBER
 - Forgetting this may cause serious disqualification trouble

#### Idea for a DHCP trap security measure:
 - For extra-secure organizations
 - New device (ID-ed by MAC address occurance counter VS average occurance):
   - Gets assigned to a trap-like address pool
   - Where ex-ACL (extended access list) blocks most of protocols and access to organization devices
 - This should be a low cost measure that just work without special software or hardware, but some tuning is needed
 - The networking specialist / Operator needs to check the trap address pool at work
 - This idea could turn to be a facepalm, or someone probably would already have it implemented and it's just that me not knowing
