I can manage enterprise networking & analyze security vulnerabilities, perform video encoding that falls within service spec via x264 & x265, using ffmpeg to handle various types of media, do PSScript-Shell-Batch-Python-Java-JS-C#-WinForms development, data analysis via Excel, prettify advanced technical documents that requires algorithm step-by-step explanation, music recomposition via FL Studio, and edit videos After Effects, Premiere, handling complicated PhotoShop projects, repair any electronics by identifing and replacing parts, setup a SOHO work environment from scratch.
- Currently studying: Java, Javascript+SVG+Ajax, Az900 Cloud Computing, System analysis and design

###### List of technical things I've spent a lot of time with
 - **Android** 4, 6, 9, 10, 13. (10 is the best version in compatibility and management without root)
 - **Windows** XP, 7, 10
   - MS SQL Server
   - PowerShell
   - CMD
   - Adobe After Effects
   - Adobe Audition
   - Adobe Premiere
   - Adove Photoshop
   - FL Studio
 - **Cisco IOS**
   - Enterprise networking, I've spent more time using it than all non-Android Linux distros combined
 - **Ubuntu** LTS 18.04, 20.04
    - Libre Office impressivly opened my x264 tutorials correctly, dispite the complicated style-based formatting and large tables used
    - Tried out Docker, the docker account registration was a tune down
    - Deployed a high availably website stack in a DMZ under another OpenWRT's zone
    - phpMyAdmin (it actually run more smoothly dispite inside an virtual machine than Microsoft IIS on my host PC)
 - **Red Hat / RHEL** 7, 8
    - Bash shells
    - Ansible & its playbook
    - Git server, GPG
    - nftable, nmap
    - Kickstart
  - **OpenWRT**
    - QoS perVLAN / SQM load balancing (it works but my home internet is Canadian so I can't tell if it has performance issues)
    - ACL (not working, no module found, too)
    - Zone Based Firewall (ZPF, it works but I hate this abbreviation which uses the wrong letter)
    - NTP to Windows & Ubuntu

Good to know:
- Many games are developed for monitors in 24" and less, that's why the view angles are so low that causes people nausea (and some only supports up to 1920x1080)
- Buying a larger display means to sacrifice many games you could play in trade off easier work and study
