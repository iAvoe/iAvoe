    - Libre Office impressivly opened my x264 tutorials correctly, dispite the complicated style-based formatting and large tables used
    - Tried out Docker, the docker account registration was a tune down

Good to know:
- Many games are developed for monitors in 24" and less, that's why the view angles are so low that causes people nausea (and some only supports up to 1920x1080)
- Buying a larger display means to sacrifice many games you could play in trade off easier work and study
